TechSprint Hackathon 2025 - Demo Video Script (2-3 Minutes)
Project: CampusPulse AI

Goal: Showcase the AI analysis, Real-time Dashboard, and Privacy features.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 1: INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Visual]: Start with a slide or the Landing Page. Facecam in corner (optional).
[Action]: 
"Hi, we are Team [Name]. In a busy campus, student voices get lost. Safety issues get buried in hundreds of 'Wi-Fi is slow' emails. 
Introducing CampusPulse AI: An intelligent platform that uses Google Gemini to listen, analyze, and prioritize student feedback in real-time."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 2: THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE (0:30 - 1:00)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Visual]: Login Screen.
[Action]: Click "Sign Up". Enter email. Show "Set Username" screen.
[Voiceover]: 
"Privacy is key. We implemented a 'Username' system so students can report issues without fear. Let's sign up as a new student."

[Visual]: Complaint Form (The Popover).
[Action]: Type a messy complaint: "hey the wires in the chem lab are sparking and it smells like burning plastic im scared."
[Voiceover]: 
"Students often report in a panic. Watch what happens when I submit this unstructured text."
[Action]: Click Submit. Show the "Analyzing..." loader.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 3: THE AI ANALYSIS (1:00 - 1:30)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Visual]: Show the result popup/card.
[Action]: Highlight the extracted fields with your mouse.
[Voiceover]: 
"Using the Gemini API, our system instantly analyzes the text.
1. It detected High Urgency.
2. It categorized it as 'Safety Hazard'.
3. It even summarized the issue and suggested an action: 'Evacuate area and call maintenance'. 
All this happens in milliseconds."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 4: THE ADMIN DASHBOARD (1:30 - 2:10)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Visual]: Switch to the Admin Dashboard (already logged in on another tab).
[Action]: Show the new complaint appearing at the top of the 'Recent Activity' list (thanks to Firestore real-time sync).
[Voiceover]: 
"Now, let's look at the Admin view. Without refreshing the page, the new complaint appears instantly."

[Action]: Use the Filter Dropdown to select "High Urgency".
[Voiceover]: 
"Admins are busy. With our 'Coffee Shop' themed dashboard, they can filter by 'High Urgency' to see only critical risks. No more digging through emails."

[Action]: Hover over the Pie Chart.
[Voiceover]: 
"They also get a visual breakdown of campus health, seeing exactly which categories need attention."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENE 5: CONCLUSION (2:10 - 2:30)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Visual]: Back to Title Slide / GitHub Repo.
[Voiceover]: 
"CampusPulse AI turns noise into actionable data. By leveraging Google Gemini and Firebase, we ensure that every student is heard and every campus is safe.
Check out our code on GitHub. Thank you!"

TIPS FOR RECORDING:
1. Clear your browser history/cache so the demo looks clean.
2. Have the Admin Dashboard open in an Incognito window so you can alt-tab between Student and Admin views quickly.
3. Zoom in your browser to 110% or 125% so the text is massive and readable on video.
